Implement a multiplexer that can choose between 4 different airthmetic operations!

The design shall have two 4-bit operands. That is, 2 digital numbers that are used as input to an arithmetic operation. These 2 inputs shall be named `a` and `b` and shall be of ´unsigned´ type.

+ (addition), - (subtraction), AND (bitwise AND) and OR (bitwise OR) are the 4 different arithmetic operations that are performed on the inputs `a` and `b`. A third input `sel` 

A third input `sel` is used to choose what arithmetic operand that shall be computed 

The entity should be named `first_test` and have two inputs; `in_a` and `in_b`. They should use the data type `std_logic`. There should be one output `in_b` which also should be of `std_logic` type.

The Architecture should be named `rtl`
